# 📊 ATM Transactions Analysis Dashboard – Project Showcase

I’m thrilled to showcase my recent project an ATM Transactions Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of transaction data, cost analysis, and revenue performance, designed to empower data-driven decisions.

🔍 The dashboard enables:
 • In-depth revenue and transaction performance analysis
 • Regional insights into uptime, financial transactions, and gross profit margins
 • Maintenance and operational cost breakdown by month
 • Margin and transaction range classification for over 2,700+ ATMs

🔧 Tools Used:
 ✅ Power BI
 ✅ DAX
 ✅ Data Modeling & Visualization
 
🎯 Key Insights:
Daily and monthly transaction trends
Most active ATM locations
Transaction success vs failure rates
Peak transaction hours

This project helped me sharpen my skills in building interactive dashboards, data storytelling, and turning raw data into actionable insights.

The design phase was brought to life using Figma, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The project highlights my skills in data visualization, business intelligence, and UI/UX design. 
The goal was to empower data-driven decision-making by highlighting operational efficiencies, regional trends, and opportunities for optimization.
This project helped me strengthen my data storytelling abilities and understand the critical role of financial and operational KPIs in managing large-scale ATM networks.
