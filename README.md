# 📊 ATM Transactions Analysis Dashboard – Project Showcase
<br>
I’m thrilled to showcase my recent project an ATM Transactions Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of transaction data, cost analysis, and revenue performance, designed to empower data-driven decisions.<br>
<br>
🔍 The dashboard enables:<br>
 • In-depth revenue and transaction performance analysis<br>
 • Regional insights into uptime, financial transactions, and gross profit margins<br>
 • Maintenance and operational cost breakdown by month<br>
 • Margin and transaction range classification for over 2,700+ ATMs<br>
<br>
🔧 Tools Used:<br>
 ✅ Power BI<br>
 ✅ DAX<br>
 ✅ Data Modeling & Visualization<br>
 <br>
🎯 Key Insights:<br>
Daily and monthly transaction trends<br>
Most active ATM locations<br>
Transaction success vs failure rates<br>
Peak transaction hours<br>
<br>
This project helped me sharpen my skills in building interactive dashboards, data storytelling, and turning raw data into actionable insights.<br>
<br>
The design phase was brought to life using Figma, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The project highlights my skills in data visualization, business intelligence, and UI/UX design. <br>
The goal was to empower data-driven decision-making by highlighting operational efficiencies, regional trends, and opportunities for optimization.<br>
This project helped me strengthen my data storytelling abilities and understand the critical role of financial and operational KPIs in managing large-scale ATM networks.<br>
